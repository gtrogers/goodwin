Goodwin is a Clojure library for capturing the state of servers. It runs shell commands via
SSH and turns the output into Clojure datastructures which can then be used in your testing
framework of choice. It is currently a work in progress.

## Usage

The `SSH>` function builds up a list of collectors to run against a server
and the `map-server` function turns the raw output into a map describing the
state of the server.

```Clojure
(ns your.awesome.project
  (:require [goodwin.core :refer :all]
            [goodwin.ssh-collectors :as c])

(let [server-data (map-server (SSH> "user@hostname"
                                    "~/.ssh/super_private_key"
                                    c/services))]
  (prn server-data)))
```
